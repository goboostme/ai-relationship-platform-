AI Relationship Platform – Technical Co-Founder Wanted (Adult / NSFW)
Overview

I run a multi-six-figure/month OnlyFans marketing agency with deep expertise in adult marketing and sales. I’m looking for a hands-on technical co-founder to help build an AI relationship platform from scratch — realistic, persistent AI companions that can chat, generate NSFW images, and create short-form videos, all at scale.

Tech Vision

The platform will combine:

Text generation: Deploy and fine-tune open-source LLMs (Qwen, Mistral, etc.)

NSFW image generation: SDXL-based workflows

NSFW video generation: Models like Hunyuan or similar open-source alternatives

GPU orchestration: RunPod, Lambda Labs, or similar

Infrastructure & scaling: Docker, cost-efficient GPU workload scaling, high-traffic consumer app architecture

Who I’m Looking For

Comfortable working in adult / NSFW

Proven ability to build and deploy AI products end-to-end (not just prompt engineering)

Familiar with optimizing LLM inference, GPU pipelines, and production-ready AI apps

Bonus: Experience in consumer-facing AI, virtual companions, or real-time media processing

Looking for one committed builder — not agencies

Why This Is Interesting

Access to an established audience and high-performing adult marketing channels

Revenue-driven project from day one

Opportunity to be founding technical lead with equity and creative control over the tech stack
